## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed

- Restored Storybook production build by switching internal Storybook component imports back to local relative paths

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-08

### Changed

- Normalized `useNavigationBlocker` semantics across adapters so `isBlocking` consistently means the blocking condition is armed
- Added optional `isIntercepting` for adapters that can expose an active interception state directly
- Tightened the public confirmation API to the parts that are actually supported end-to-end
- Clarified README guidance around adapter capabilities, async confirmation behavior, and Next.js App Router limitations
- Aligned package scripts and Storybook component exports with the current package structure

### Fixed

- Async `onConfirm` handlers are now evaluated once per blocked navigation attempt across adapters
- Storybook barrel exports and imports now match the reusable components and utilities shipped with the package
